  Drive a single pull request to merge-ready across all five criteria (sync, CI,

  library skill invoked by the /tm, /issues, /fix-pr, and /fix-develop commands and
  by marathon teammates. TRIGGER when a command or agent needs the PR review-to-green
  loop or the smart-merge (stale-bot-CR dismissal, auto-merge criteria, UNSTABLE/UNKNOWN
  handling, merge ordering), or when the user asks to take a PR to green/merge it.

# PR Review-to-Green + Smart Merge

Source-agnostic. Consumers pass: PR number, base branch, and bot-reviewer/CI rules
from the project's `## Marathon Configuration` (defaults if absent).

## Ready Criteria (ALL must be true)

The PR is merge-ready only when all five are simultaneously true. Re-check from the top after every push — a fix can reopen an earlier criterion.

1. **Branch in sync** — no merge conflicts with base branch
2. **CI passing** — all checks succeed (or skipped)
3. **All inline comments addressed** — see thread resolution rules
4. **No unaddressed conversation comments** — actionable feedback responded to
5. **All review threads resolved** — no unresolved threads remain

**Thread resolution rules:**
Follow bot reviewer rules from the project's CLAUDE.md Marathon Configuration. Generic defaults:
- **Bot threads**: Fix the code and push. Resolve via GraphQL if addressed. Use jq JSON builder (avoids zsh `$` escaping):
  ```bash
  jq -n --arg tid "$THREAD_ID" '{"query": "mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: \"\($tid)\"}) { thread { isResolved } } }"}' | gh api graphql --input -
  ```
- **Human threads**: Fix the code, reply inline explaining the fix, `@mention` the reviewer. Do NOT resolve human threads — let the reviewer confirm.

## Shell Pitfalls

**Never use `gh ... --jq` with complex filters.** Always pipe to `jq` separately.

**Use positive jq filters, not negative.** zsh escapes `!=` to `\!=`, breaking filters silently:
```bash
# WRONG: gh pr view --json reviews --jq '.reviews[] | select(.state != "APPROVED")'
# WRONG: gh pr view --json reviews | jq '.reviews[] | select(.state != "APPROVED")'
# RIGHT:
gh pr view --json reviews | jq '.reviews[] | select(.state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED")'
```

## Review Loop (each iteration)

## Smart Merge

description: >
  Run a list of work units to completion with an Agent Team: derive a dependency DAG and
  hot-file map, spawn one ephemeral teammate per unit (or combined group), drive each PR
  through pr-review-merge, smart-merge in waves, recover from crashes, and run a
  retrospective. Source-agnostic — the caller supplies a work-source adapter. Invoked by
  the /tm and /issues commands. TRIGGER when a command needs autonomous multi-unit team
  orchestration to completion, or when the user asks to run a tag/issue queue to done with
  Agent Teams.

# Marathon Engine

Source-agnostic team orchestration. The caller supplies a **work-source adapter**; this
skill owns DAG analysis, hot-file combining, team lifecycle, waves, crash recovery, and
the retrospective. It uses the `pr-review-merge` skill for every PR.

## Work-Source Adapter Contract

The calling command MUST fill these four operations before invoking this skill:

| Operation | What it returns / does |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **enumerate** | A list of work units, each `{id, title, requirements, dependencies[], complexity}` |
| **mark in-progress** | Marks one unit started in the source of truth |
| **close on merge** | How a merged PR closes the unit (e.g. a label, a status set, or PR `Closes #N`) |
| **branch / worktree** | The branch name and `worktree/<...>` path convention for a unit |

The caller also passes Marathon Configuration values (base branch, required approvals,
bot-reviewer rules, CI patterns) read from the project's CLAUDE.md.

## Phase 0: Capability Detection

## Step 1: DAG + Hot-File Analysis

## Step 2: Team + Tracking

## Step 3: Spawn Teammates

## Step 4: Lead Monitoring

## Smart Merge

## Crash Recovery

## Completion + Retrospective

## Subagent Fallback (no teams)
